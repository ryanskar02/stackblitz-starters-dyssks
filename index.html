        We want to be able to deposit money into our OPEN accounts, if an
        account is not open then we want to inform the user the account isn't
        open

      <li>
        We want to CLOSE an open account and in doing so set the balance to 0
      </li>
      <li>
        We want to be able to withdraw money from our open accounts, if the
        balance of the account allows for it. If the balance is less than the
        requested withdraw amount, then we want to let the user know that "There
        are not enough funds to withdraw the requested amount"
      </li>
      <li>We want to be able to get the balance of an open account</li>
      <li>
        We want to be able to transfer an amount from a current open account to
        another, target, open account. If either account is not open, we want to
        let the user know this. If the balance of the current account is
        insufficient to make the transfer then we want to let the user know
        this.
